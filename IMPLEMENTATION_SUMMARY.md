## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation

### Authentication Fixed
- **Issue**: "unauthorized token failed" error
- **Solution**: 
  - Updated Redux slices to use `userAPI` from existing axios config
  - Fixed backend controllers to use `req.user._id` instead of `req.user.id`
  - Removed manual token handling in favor of existing auth system

### API Integration
- **Backend**: All endpoints working with proper JWT authentication
- **Frontend**: Using existing `userAPI` instance for consistent auth handling
- **Error Handling**: Proper error messages and user feedback

### State Management
- **Redux Slices**: `cartSlice.js` and `wishlistSlice.js`
- **Real-time Updates**: Header counters update automatically
- **Optimistic Updates**: UI updates immediately with API calls in background
